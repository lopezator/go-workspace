# go-workspace

This a repo following the guide on go workspaces here:

https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces

More info about workspaces can also be found here:

# Main concepts

- `go.work` can be used to tell the Go command that youâ€™re writing code in 
multiple modules at the same time and easily build and run code in those modules. This way, you can `build` and `run`
code from the different submodules (hello, example) without having to go into each folder/module separately. The 
workspace acts a single module, composed by one or more submodules.
- `go.work` can be used instead of adding replace directives to work across multiple modules. In the `example` folder
we customized the code of https://go.googlesource.com/example and told the Go command to use the local copy instead
of fetching and using the remote repository.
- When no `go.work` file exists, the workspace consists of the single module containing the current directory.
- `go.work` files also allow to specify replaces to other upstream modules via the replace directive.

# Demo

1. Run the hello module from the workspace, making use of the `go.work` file and the modifications in the `example` folder
over the https://go.googlesource.com/example module.

```shell
go run github.com/lopezator/go-workspace/hello
```

Returns: `HELLO`.

2. Remove the `./example` line from the `go.work` file and run again the hello module.

```shell
go run github.com/lopezator/go-workspace/hello
```

This fails, because the `ToUpper` function is not present in the upstream module https://go.googlesource.com/example

```
go run github.com/lopezator/go-workspace/hello
# github.com/lopezator/go-workspace/hello
hello/hello.go:10:25: undefined: stringutil.ToUpper
```
